Submitted by: Kevon Dawkins

Time spent: **17** hours spent in total

## Summary

**NASA APOD Viewer** is an android app that **fetches and displays the Astronomy Picture of the Day from NASA's API in a scrollable list with titles, dates, and images**.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üöÄü™ê‚ú®**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] App contains a RecyclerView that displays a list of scrollable data
- [x] App displays at least two (2) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item
- [x] Use a downloadable font with custom color and size
- [x] Modify the theme of the app in `themes.xml`
- [x] Define and apply at least one style in **either** `themes.xml` or a new file `styles.xml`

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Update the night theme to use different versions of styles when in dark mode
- [x] Use different drawables when in dark mode

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Added card-style layout with rounded corners for each item
